This requirement states that a service should have a defined contract duration. Contract duration states the start and the end date of the subscription to the service or that the subscription doesn't have an end date.

If the contract duration states the end date of the subscription it should also state whether the subscription can be extended. If it can, it should also state if the subscription is going to auto extend without the consumers acknowledgement.

It should also state under what circumstances can the service provider involuntarily unsubscribe the consumer (e. g., breach of Terms & Conditions) from the service. Similarly the service consumer should also be able end the service subscription before the end date (if there is one) on his own just by unsubscribing from the service.

## Requirements

- Create a file/page which defines the contract duration
- Define cases when the consumer will be involuntarily unsubscribed from the service
- Define that the consumer can unsubscribe from the service on his own at any time
- Define whether the service subscription can be extended and whether it auto extends

## Reasoning

Defining a contract duration brings transparency to booth the consumer and the provider and creates a clear understanding of what the subscription duration is and rules which the consumer should follow to stay subscribed to the service.

A well defined contract duration also mitigates the risk of any misunderstandings between the consumer and the provider which may otherwise lead to a conflict.
