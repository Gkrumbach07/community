This requirement states that a service should have a defined contract duration. Contract duration states a start and an end of a subscription to the service and the conditions under which the subscription is terminated.

If the contract duration states the end date of the subscription it should also state whether the subscription can be extended. If it can, it should also state if the subscription is going to auto extend without the consumers explicit acknowledgement.

It states the circumstances when the service provider can involuntarily terminate the consumer's subscription (e. g. what constitutes a breach of Terms and Conditions). Additionally the service consumer should be advised how to end the service subscription on his own just at any time, especially in a case when the contract specifies a distinct end date of the subscription and what terms apply in such scenario.

## Requirements

- Create a file/page which defines the contract duration
- Define cases when the consumer will be involuntarily unsubscribed from the service
- Define if and how the consumer can unsubscribe from the service on his own at any time
- Define whether the service subscription can be extended and whether it auto extends
- Contract duration document is not just a link to lengthy Terms and Conditions but rather a simple list that links back to the Terms and Conditions
- Contract duration is not a marketing or lawyer material. That means it is worded accordingly to the target audience - users. It should be easy to read and understandable.

## Reasoning

Defining a contract duration manages expectations of both the service consumer and the provider transparently. It specifies the subscription duration, and the rules that the consumer should follow to stay subscribed and how to leave the service.

A well defined contract duration also mitigates the risk of any misunderstandings between the consumer and the provider which may otherwise lead to a conflict.
