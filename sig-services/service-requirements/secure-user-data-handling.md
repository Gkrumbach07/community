title: Secure user data handling is defined
persona: service provider / owner
phase: service-design, service-operational

This requirement states that the service should clearly outline how user data is securely handled for the duration of the contract, as well as after its termination.

## Requirements

- A file / page is created which describes user data handling in various contexts of the service, including the following
  - how the data obtained during user sign-up is stored and used
  - how the data obtained during service usage is stored and used
  - what happens to user data after service contract terminates
- If third party services have access to user data, then how they ensure secure data handling should also be outlined.
- If the service complies with legal guidelines or regulations, for example the GDPR in EU, it should be explained.
- The description should be easy to read and understand by the end user.

## Reasoning

Clearly defining how user data is handled would help users better understand the security implications of using the service. Additionally, it would help the users as well as the service provider determine whether the service complies with any legal guidelines or regulations put in place in some regions, for example the GDPR in the EU or the HIPAA in the US.
